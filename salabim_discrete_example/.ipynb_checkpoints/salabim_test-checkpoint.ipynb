    "# Discrete Event Simulation (DES)\n",
    "Figuring out the best way to route components through a system is a complicated problem, with many real-world applications. For example, disaster responders may want to know the best way to distribute relief items after a hurricane. Or, hospital administrators may want to know the best way to set up their rooms to ensure patients are seen as quickly as possible. In either of these examples, the problems are too critical to just find the best way through trial-and-error. Instead, it can be highly useful to create a **simulation**, which models the transport of relief goods or patients through a process. Injecting elements of stochasticity help reflect the uncertainty inherent in the real world and can provide a better understanding of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A model helps to perform \"what if?\" analysis, where questions about the system are posed and tested in the simulation, helping decision makers prepare for different future scenarios. **Discrete event simulation** in particular, is well-suited to problems where components change at different points in time as a result of events. Between two consecutive events, the system is assumed to be steady-state, so the simulation effectively skips from one event to the following event. This is different than **continuous simulation**, where the dynamics of the system are tracked over time uninterrupted. \n",
    "\n",
    "One library for discrete simulation is **salabim**, an open-source python library. There are many alternatives for performing discrete simulation (for instance, see [this wikipedia list](https://wiki2.org/en/List_of_discrete_event_simulation_software)) however, many of them have considerable learning curves and expensive liscenses. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Salabim Tutorial\n",
    "The Salabim library was written by Ruud van der Ham, an expert in discrete modeling from the Netherlands, who wrote the library to make discrete modeling more accessible to python users. The library can be installed easily using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip install salabim`\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation and examples are available at: https://www.salabim.org/manual/index.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin modeling in salabim, the most important part of the library to understand are **components**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Components\n",
    "Components are defined as **classes** in salabim, using the syntax `sim.Component`. Unlike traditional definitions in python however, salabim components do not *return* something, they *yield* something. Basically, the best way to create a component is to define it like so:\n",
    "    `class Patient(sim.Component):\n",
    "        def process(self):\n",
    "            ....`\n",
    "\n",
    "A **generator** is a function with at least one yield statement, which are used as a signal to give control to the sequence mechanism. When yield is followed by self, it means that it is the component to be held for some time\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two kinds of components in salabim simulations: data components and active components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Active components\n",
    "An active component contains one or more **processes**. To create an active component, you have to define a class firt, and then you can add pocesses (which usually contain at least one yield statement).\n",
    "    `class Doctor(sim.Component):\n",
    "        def process(self):\n",
    "        ...\n",
    "        yield ...\n",
    "        ... `\n",
    "Once this class is created, it is then *activated* at some point in time. you can activate the class you created by making a new instance of the class:\n",
    "    `doctor_1 = Doctor()\n",
    "     doctor_2 = Doctor()\n",
    "     doctor_3 = Doctor()`\n",
    "\n",
    "An active component can later become a data component through one of two ways: (1) using *cancel* or (2) by reaching the end of its process. If no processes are found in a class you created, it will be treated as a data component. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data components\n",
    "A data component is one that has no associated process method. To create a data component, simpy use:\n",
    "`data_component = sim.Component()`\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make a data component active later by means of an activate statement. \n",
    "    `nurse1 = Nurse()\n",
    "     nurse1.activate(process='treat')`\n",
    "        \n",

    "## Water collection example\n",
    "In this example, we'll use Salabim to simulate women walking to a public well in order to fill up a container of water. Today, [tens of millions of women](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2016/07/07/484793736/millions-of-women-take-a-long-walk-with-a-40-pound-water-can) still walk long distances to collect water for household use. These water containers are heavy and bulky (generally weighing 40 pounds or more) and trips take 30 minutes or longer. Often, multiple trips are taken per day. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation setup\n",
    "We'll create the following processes:\n",
    "- The **person_generator** creates the women, with a uniform inter arrival time.\n",
    "- The **women** who visit the well. They wait in a queue and are served in a first-in, first out order.\n",
    "- The water well collection point, which we'll model as a **Resource** in Salabim. Resources have a limited capacity, just like our water collection point. They are useful for simulation because they can be claimed by components and released later, which is the case here because not every woman who arrives can fill her bucket all at once. Instead, they must form a queue. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things a little more interesting, we'll also include two environmental features:\n",
    "- The **number who turn around** when they arrive at the well and see that the line is too long. \n",
    "- The **number who leave early** after waiting in the queue for a long time. \n",
